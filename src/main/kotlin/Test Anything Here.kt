    // - Hash sets
   // HashSets are just like sets, but closer in behaviour to mutable sets than immutable sets.
//These have the additional characteristic of using a hash table implementation for efficient element storage and retrieval,
//which can result in faster lookup times compared to some other types of sets,
//especially when dealing with a large number of elements.
